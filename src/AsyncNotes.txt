main thread ----> asyn task in seperate thread
            <---- reports completion or error
Good for writing non blocking code

Future introduced in Java 5 (isDone and get), CompletionStage
        | implements
CompletableFuture Java 8

Limitations:
1. Cannot be completed manually
2. without using get, you cant continue the operations
3. chaining not possible
4. combining results not possible
5. No exception handling

----------------------
1. Creation
2. runAsync, supplyAsync
3. thenApply, thenAccept, thenRun

What if callbacks are also async?
thenApplyAsync, thenRunAsync thenRunAsync

Where do they get executed?

Part 2:
1. How to overcome 4th limitation?
what if callback returns completable future and you wanna flatten that?
use thenCombine, thenCompose, thenAcceptBoth
allOf, anyOf

2. 5th limitation
exceptionally
handle
